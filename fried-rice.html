  <p id="intro-text">
    Fried rice, filled with savory vegetables and sauteed meats, and topped with a crispy fried egg, is a delicious combination of healthy carbs, protein, and fat. Plus, gut-friendly fiber without being overwhelming. Soy sauce, sesame oil, and a few green onions to garnish pull together a really simple dish with complex flavor. Get creative and try adding potatoes, salsa, and green chili for a Southwestern spin. <br /><a href="http://paleomg.com/breakfast-fried-rice/" target="_blank" class="result-link">Click here to get a paleo recipe for Breakfast Fried Rice!</a>
